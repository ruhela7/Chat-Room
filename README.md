HI. This is Single Room Chat App Project, where multiple users can participate and chat. This Chat App is Complete Responsive.

Instructions to run project on your local host.
> To run the backend server, in your root directory i.e. 'Chat-Room' run command "npm start" which will start server on "http://localhost:5000".
> To run the frontend, enter into 'client' and run command "npm start" which will start react app on "http://localhost:3000". Enter your name and click on "Start Chatting" button which will redirect you on
